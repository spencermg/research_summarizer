      "Meta-reductive approach Introduction, Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have emerged\n",
      "as an essential tool in the field of genetics. These scores offer a unique\n",
      "insight into an individual’s genetic predisposition to a wide array of diseases\n",
      "and traits, capturing the cumulative effects of multiple genetic variants. The\n",
      "Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) serve as the base for creating PRS. GWAS\n",
      "investigates the entire genetic makeup of individuals to identify genetic\n",
      "variations associated with specific diseases or traits. The predictive accuracy\n",
      "and precision of PRS are enhanced when the base GWAS summary statistics come\n",
      "from a sizeable sample, and the population in the GWAS matches the population\n",
      "where the PRS is being applied. Due to this need for a substantial sample size,\n",
      "studies often aim to meta-analyze all available genetic datasets to achieve the\n",
      "statistical power necessary for identifying genetic markers linked to the trait\n",
      "or disease. However, this approach presents a challenge in securing independent\n",
      "datasets for training, testing, and validating PRS performance. The use of\n",
      "overlapping samples can inflate the PRS calculations, resulting in imprecise\n",

      "Nonetheless, we do have access to the cohort-level data for the specific dataset\n",

      "diversity and quantity of so-called lifestyle diseases are rising quickly due to\n",
      "detrimental changes in both the modern world's lifestyle and environment.\n",
      "Several factors, including poor eating habits and food composition that includes\n",
      "an excessive intake of energy, a high intake of fats, carbohydrates, and salt,\n",
      "as well as a deficiency in fibre and vitamins, are contributing to this harmful\n",
      "phenomenon. Not only should doctors and nutrition experts strive to improve the\n",
      "situation by educating the public more thoroughly, but food manufacturers should\n",
      "also make a point of offering their products with higher declared concentrations\n",
      "of positively acting and biologically active substances. The subject of global\n",
      "debate in recent years become a polyphenolic substance. Higher plants contain\n",
      "thousands of molecules with a polyphenol structure identified, and edible plants\n",
      "contain several hundred of these molecules. Depending on how many phenol rings\n",
      "they contain and what structural components, like phenolic acids, flavonoids,\n",
      "stilbenes, and lignans, bind these rings together, these compounds can be\n",
      "categorized into various groups. While polyphenols are not essential nutrients,\n",
      "their protective antioxidant properties inhibit oxidative damage of biological\n",
      "systems, which is a reason for their health benefits. The food industry faces a\n",
      "challenge due to the high antioxidant activity of plant phenolic compounds.\n",
      "Massive amounts of various primary and secondary metabolites are produced by\n",
      "plants. Increased production of polyphenols in the plant responds to causes of\n",
      "stress. A class of plant metabolites known as flavonoids are believed to have\n",
      "antioxidant properties and to improve cell signaling pathways. Numerous fruits\n",
      "and vegetables contain these molecules. A special kind of bioflavonoid,\n",
      "quercetin has been the subject of much research in the last thirty years. In\n",
      "1930, bioflavonoids were first identified. When taken in the right dosage,\n",
      "quercetin has been shown in numerous studies to have a wide range of biological\n",
      "activities, including immunomodulatory, antibacterial, antitumor,\n",
      "neuroprotective, antiallergic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties.\n",
      "Quercetin can lower blood pressure in hypertensive individuals and lower their\n",
      "chance of developing cardiovascular disease, according to clinical research.\n",
      "Additionally, it might lessen inflammation and muscle damage following exercise.\n",
      "Methodology, Scientific literature review encompasses the results obtained\n",
      "through searching the keywords “quercetin,” “flavonoid,” “characterization,”\n",
      "“nutrition,” “phytochemical,” “plant,” and “biological activity” in major\n",
      "databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, Elsevier, Springer, Google Scholar, up\n",
      "until February 2024., All used articles are published and reviewed by several\n",
      "experts in the field. Summarization of the articles took place based on the use\n",

      "for the objective compilation of this review article (Fig. 1). Results and\n",
      "discussion, Flavonoids, Flavonoids are secondary metabolites present in a range\n",
      "of plants that play a crucial part in the plant's ability to survive by carrying\n",
      "out physiological functions and withstanding negative environmental effects. A\n",
      "vast class of C-15 (C6–C3–C6) secondary metabolites known as flavonoids are\n",
      "found in many higher plants (Fig. 2) as well as some lower plants like algae. A\n",
      "three-carbon unit that may or may not form a third ring (C) connects two\n",
      "aromatic rings (A and B) in the basic skeleton of flavonoids, which have a\n",
      "variety of chemical structures made up of fifteen carbon atoms., The majority of\n",
      "these secondary metabolites, referred to as flavonoids (flavone, flavonol,\n",
      "flavanone, flavanonol, flavan, flavanol), can be formed by joining the B-ring to\n",
      "the C-ring at positions C-2, C-3, or C-4. Isoflavones, biflavonoids,\n",
      "flavonolignans, prenylflavonoids, flavonoid glycoside esters, aurones, and\n",
      "chalcones are other classes of flavonoid compounds. The general structures of\n",
      "the most common flavonoids are shown in Fig. 3., The most significant subclass\n",
