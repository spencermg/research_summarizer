      "effectiveness. It has already been speculated that supplementation with MI\n",
      "alleviates the insulin resistance symptoms in diabetic and Polycystic Ovary\n",
      "Syndrome (PCOS) patients, but the results of studies found in the literature are\n",
      "not clear. In some sources, we can find information about the MI’s ability to\n",
      "control insulin activity, improve insulin sensitivity, and has salutary effects\n",
      "in people with diabetes. Sharma et al. report that MI has the potential to\n",
      "regulate insulin, aiding in the prevention and management of diabetes mellitus.\n",
      "Additionally, it has the advantage of being an inexpensive and safe alternative\n",
      "to commonly used drugs. Unfer et al. performed an analysis of various studies on\n",
      "MI supplementation for improving hormonal imbalances in PCOS and provide the\n",
      "level Ia evidence of MI’s effectiveness. In a study by Zhao et al. MI\n",
      "multicomponent supplementation with D-chiro-Inositol (DCI) was ranked best at\n",
      "improving menstrual frequency and this combination was found to be superior the\n",
      "supplementation of MI or DCI alone. However, there are still few studies on the\n",
      "anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of MI. There are reports of reduced levels\n",
      "of brain MI in patients with depression and anxiety compared to healthy controls\n",
      "and low plasma MI concentrations have been suggested as a possible marker of\n",
      "major depressive disorders. Also, PCOS patients often suffer from depression or\n",
      "anxiety, related to hormonal disturbances and weight gain. Cantelmi et al.\n",
      "report that MI supplementation turned out to reduce these symptoms. In studies\n",
      "concerning possible antidepressant and anxiolytic inositol activity, researchers\n",
      "used MI and its stereoisomers such as Epi-Inositol (EI), Scyllo-Inositol (SI),\n",
      "and also D-pinitol; an analog of MI widely found in many plant families. Most of\n",
      "these studies suggest the positive effect of MI supplementation on depression\n",
      "and anxiety. However, as we mentioned before the recent guidelines by the World\n",
      "Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) report that inositol is\n",
      "not advised for treating depression and lacks sufficient evidence for its\n",
      "effectiveness in treating anxiety Mashayekh-Amiri et al.. Ref. report an\n",
      "improvement in sleep quality in pregnant women supplemented with MI. SI\n",
      "contributes to the reduction of symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients\n",
      "with Alzheimer’s Disease. EI is a stereoisomer absent in mammalian tissue, but\n",
      "present in pine bark. In research from Einat et al., the plus-maze model of\n",
      "anxiety in mice was used to test the anxiolytic-like activity of EI and MI. EI\n",
      "had the strongest anxiolytic-like effect, followed by MI, in comparison to the\n",
      "control group. D-pinitol has also been shown to have an antidepressant and\n",
      "anxiolytic effect. In a review of the plant-based methods of anxiety and\n",
      "depression treatment by Fajemiroye et al., researchers list a plant that\n",
      "originated in Brazil, Mimosa pudica, in which D-pinitol is one of the active\n",
      "principles. It has an antidepressant-like effect, mediated by the serotonergic\n",
      "system. It is used in the treatment of depression and insomnia and is consumed\n",
      "in the form of an infusion of dried leaves. Alonso-Castro et al. analyzed the\n",
      "effects of an ethanol extract of Senna septemtrionalis aerial parts (consisting\n",
      "of 42% D-pinitol) on mice behavior. D-pinitol showed anxiolytic-like activity in\n",
      "the four anxiety models and this effect turned out to be stronger than after\n",
      "fluoxetine administration., This is the second research to date in which MI\n",
      "activity was tested on the Danio rerio. In this study, we used concentrations of\n",
      "MI with a maximum value of 40 mg/mL. Based on our previous research, in which we\n",
      "conducted the fish embryo toxicity (FET) test, MI concentrations higher than 40\n",
      "mg/mL turned out to be toxic and led to significant disturbances in zebrafish\n",

      "the possible MI’s anxiolytic activity and behavioral changes in Zebrafish\n",
      "embryos and larvae. In the behavioral assessment, researchers often use the\n",

      "activity increased during the initial part of the dark period, which is in line\n",
      "with other authors’ outcomes. Zebrafish larvae are showing aversion toward\n",
      "darkness, which leads to an increase of the traveled distance when compared to\n",
      "the light phase. In our research, average distance moved was higher in the dark\n",

      "Politicizing science funding undermines public trust in science, academic\n",
      "freedom, and the unbiased generation of knowledge Do we want the mixture of\n",
      "students who are going to be trained to do advanced medical research to be\n",
      "representative of the demographic make-up of the population as a whole—or do we\n",
      "want whatever students, from whatever backgrounds, who have track records\n",
      "demonstrating a mastery of medical science that gives them the highest\n",
      "probability of finding cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, and other devastating\n",
      "diseases? Endeavors have purposes. Is indulging ideological visions more\n",
      "important than ending cancer and Alzheimer's?, 1 Introduction, Science is\n",
      "essential for humankind to thrive. Science is the foundation of technologies\n",
      "that deliver food, energy, and medicine. Scientific progress has contributed to\n",
      "the greatly improved human condition worldwide, including higher standards of\n",
      "living, lengthened lifespans, and the eradication of deadly diseases and famine.\n",
      "Science was the key ingredient of the industrial revolution, which propelled\n",
      "Western democracies to economic prosperity. Maintaining strong basic science\n",
      "research and education is essential for a country's security and technological\n",
      "competitiveness. The U.S. and other developed countries have long recognized the\n",
      "need for sustained support of the STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering,\n",
      "Mathematics, and Medicine) fields., The U.S. invests hundreds of billions of\n",
      "dollars annually in support of STEMM (AIP, (n.d.)). These funds, which\n",
      "ultimately derive from the taxpayers, are managed by federal funding agencies,\n",
      "whose role is to distribute these resources to scientists and to ensure that the\n",
      "funds are used effectively to produce the best outcomes for the public good.\n",
      "Funding agencies, therefore, play a key role in the scientific enterprise, the\n",
      "production of knowledge, and—ultimately—technological progress and improved\n",
      "quality of life., In the U.S., the major agencies responsible for science\n",
      "funding are the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of\n",
      "Health (NIH), the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Aeronautics and Space\n",
      "Administration (NASA), and the Department of Defense (DOD). Funding agencies\n",
      "have domains and priorities defined by their missions. For example, NSF funds\n",
      "fundamental research, NIH focuses on research related to human health, DOE\n",
      "supports research related to energy, and NASA funds research related to space.\n",
      "Table 1 lists the mission statements of selected agencies., The U.S. funding\n",
      "agencies have excellent track records, as evidenced by the immense success that\n",
      "American science has enjoyed (Graham and Diamond,; Urquiola,). Recently,\n",
      "however, the function of these essential institutions has been undergoing\n",
      "significant changes. There has been a broad effort to use science funding to\n",
      "further the “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” (DEI) agenda (OSTP,; Barabino et\n",
      "al.,). While the terms “diversity,” “equity,” and “inclusion” connote lofty\n",
      "goals with which the majority of Americans agree, a close look at what is\n",
      "actually implemented under the DEI umbrella reveals that these words represent\n",
      "something entirely different., Actual DEI policies do not promote viewpoint\n",
      "diversity, equitable treatment of individuals based on their accomplishments, or\n",
      "equal opportunity for individuals regardless of their identity (e.g., race, sex,\n",
      "ethnicity). It can scarcely be questioned (Krylov and Tanzman,) that DEI\n",
      "programs today are driven by an ideology, an offshoot of Critical Social\n",
      "Justice1 (CSJ) (Pluckrose,; Deichmann,). DEI programs elevate the collective\n",
      "above the individual. They group people into categories defined by immutable\n",
      "characteristics (race, sex, etc.) and classify each group as either “privileged”\n",
      "or “victimized,” as “oppressor” or “oppressed.” The goals of DEI programs are to\n",
      "have each group participate in proportion to their fraction of the population in\n",
      "every endeavor of society and to obtain proportionate outcomes from those\n",
      "endeavors. Disproportionate outcomes (with respect to science, such outcomes as\n",
      "publications, funding, citations, salaries, and awards), or disparities, are\n",
      "axiomatically ascribed to systemic factors, such as systemic racism and sexism,\n",
      "without consideration of alternative explanations (Sowell,). Claims, such as\n",
      "“The presence of disparities is proof of systemic racism” and “Meritocracy is a\n",
      "myth” are propagated widely despite the vagueness of the claims and their lack\n",
      "of support by concrete data. Similarly, tenets that are central to DEI\n",
      "ideology—such as diversity is excellence, diverse teams outperform homogenous\n",
      "teams, and the advancement of women is impeded by biases—lack a robust evidence\n",
      "base, particularly when applied to science (Ceci et al.,; Abbot et al.,; Krylov\n",
      "and Tanzman,; Ceci and Williams,). Table 2 lists several examples of such\n",
      "axiomatic statements that funding agencies have made., Disturbingly, CSJ is\n",
      "increasingly infused into every domain of the scientific enterprise—education,\n",
