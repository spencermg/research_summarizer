      "single-layer omics genetic studies that incorporate participants from multiple\n",
      "ancestries rather than just a single ancestry. In 2022, two proteomic studies\n",
      "were published: (i) Zhang et al., investigated plasma proteomic data from\n",
      "participants of European and African ancestries within the Atherosclerosis Risk\n",
      "in Communities (ARIC) cohort; (ii) Schubert et al., examined plasma proteomic\n",
      "data from African American, East Asian, European, and Hispanics participants\n",
      "within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort. Both studies\n",
      "applied the TWAS framework to study the cis-only protein effects on diseases.\n",
      "Consequently, they coined the term PWAS specifically for studying the proteome.\n",
      "Additionally, a more recent study, published in 2023 with the largest-to-date\n",
      "sample size by Sun et al., used the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project\n",
      "(UKB-PPP) cohort and generated genome-wide multi-ancestry protein-QTL (pQTL)\n",
      "datasets., Meanwhile, single ancestry multi-omic genetic studies have also been\n",

      "genetic associations in both the plasma proteome and metabolome (Fig. 1). Next,\n",
      "we applied them to pinpoint key proteins/metabolites underlying the risk loci of\n",
      "ancestry-matched T2D. Our study used plasma omics to study T2D for two reasons:\n",
      "1) T2D GWAS have the largest sample sizes in both European (EUR) and African\n",
      "(AFR) ancestries. This provides more genome-wide significant loci to consider\n",
      "when studying this disease; 2) plasma analytes are more relevant to metabolic\n",
      "disorders, such as T2D, compared to diseases that are enriched in certain tissue\n",
      "types, such as the brain for neurological disorders. In our study, we also\n",

      "one previously unreported protein and one previously unreported metabolite.,\n",
      "Even we identified AFR-specific proteins and metabolites, the power of\n",
      "identifying unique signals in this ancestry is still lower than in EUR, as the\n",
      "sample size in the disease GWAS and omic data is much lower in AFR, leading to\n",
      "fewer disease-associated loci and xQTLs. Therefore, future research with larger\n",
      "disease GWAS and QTL maps from diverse populations is still necessary. In this\n",
      "study, we only nominate proteins or metabolites that met the stringent criteria\n",
      "of being identified through all three integrative strategies: XWAS,\n",
      "colocalization, and MR. This assures the highest confidence in these identified\n",
      "effectors being implicated in T2D. However, some proteins and metabolites\n",
      "survived in only two of the three criteria, which could warrant broader\n",
      "investigation., There are four notable strengths of this study. First, it\n",
      "represents a large-scale research endeavor that encompasses multi-ancestry and\n",
      "multi-omics analyses, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of diverse\n",
      "populations and molecular trait layers at the same time. Second, we included\n",
      "trans QTLs into the conventional cis QTL framework, enabling the discovery of\n",
      "more heritable features and expanding our understanding of the genetic\n",
      "underpinnings of the studied traits. In addition, we integrate this QTL data\n",
      "with FUSION, colocalization and Mendelian Randomization approaches to identify\n",
      "high confidence proteins and metabolites implicated on T2D. Our analyses provide\n",
      "additional support for some of the nominated effector genes (Dtk, C1QT4, and\n",
      "MANBA), but also nominated two new proteins in the EUR-specific analyses. One\n",
      "protein, TBCE, is located in a known locus, and we are nominated this protein as\n",
      "functional in this locus. As mentioned, in this study we not-only performed\n",
      "cis-QTL mapping but extended to trans-QTL as this can help to identify novel\n",
      "molecular interactions that otherwise will not be identified. The other novel\n",
      "protein identified in this study to be implicated on T2D is TPP2. The\n",
      "association of this protein with T2D, is through a trans-QTL with a SNPs located\n",
      "on a locus that includes ERT1 or MFHAS1 as potential effector genes. Additional\n",
      "studies are needed to determine how TPP2 and ERT1 or MFHSA1 interacts with each\n",
      "other, but this study provides strong evidence that these genes are part of the\n",
      "same pathway and it is a good example of how this unbiased analyses will\n",
      "identify new protein-protein interactions. Third, by performing ancestry-matched\n",
      "omics-disease integration, we enhanced the accuracy of our findings in\n",
      "comparison to previous studies that included ancestry-mixed data. This approach\n",
      "may contribute to more precise identification of T2D effector genes within\n",
      "specific ancestral populations. Fourth, to ensure the robustness of our\n",
      "conclusions, we cross-referenced our findings against the two largest\n",
      "multi-ancestry T2D studies. This stringent evaluation allowed us to determine\n",
      "whether our identified effectors had been reported previously or not, further\n",
      "reinforcing the significance of our results., On the flip side, there are\n",
      "several limitations to consider in our study. First, our study did not integrate\n",
      "proteomics and metabolomics data due to the lack of colocalization between\n",
      "protein, metabolite, and the ancestry-matched T2D risk loci (data not show).\n",
      "Nonetheless, we believe that genetic colocalization of proteomics and\n",
      "metabolomics could exist if we were not solely focused on T2D-associated loci.\n",
      "Second, there were unequal sample sizes between participants of EUR and AFR\n",
      "ancestry. This discrepancy in sample sizes affected the power to detect QTLs,\n",
      "even though we were well-powered to identify the sentinel variants (Table S9).\n",
      "To mitigate this bias in identifying ancestry-specific findings, we employed\n",
      "standardized z-values that accounted for both effect size and standard error,\n",
      "rather than relying solely on p-values, when comparing the two ancestral groups.\n",
      "Third, our study utilized plasma bulk-tissue, which may not reflect the cell\n",
      "type of interest when studying T2D, such as pancreatic islets or beta cells. But\n",
      "as plasma circulates throughout the body, our study holds value in investigating\n",
      "human metabolic disorders in general. Fourth, our study utilized one certain\n",
      "platform for measuring proteomics and the other for metabolomics, this can lead\n",
      "to platform-biased results. We, however, addressed this concern by querying our\n",
      "findings with external pQTL and mQTL studies that used both the same and\n",
      "different platforms. Fifth, our cohort consisted of participants with various\n",
      "disease statuses, including Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, and\n",
      "healthy individuals. We and other researchers, however, have reported that few\n",
      "pQTLs or mQTLs were status-specific. Thus, it suggests that the disease status\n",
      "is unlikely to have a significant impact, although further studies will be\n",
      "necessary. Sixth, we defined our participants based on genetic ancestry, thus we\n",
      "used “African” ancestry rather than African American. We acknowledge our study\n",
      "may contain admixed participants, which could potentially underestimate the\n",
      "ancestry-specific features observed., While our study focused on applying these\n",
      "plasma xQTLs to the study of T2D, it is worth noting that these QTL maps can be\n",
      "expanded to explore other diseases as well. These nominated proteins and\n",
      "metabolites are key intermediate phenotypes that can connect the genotype to the\n",
      "disease endpoint. Therefore, identifying these effectors in diverse populations\n",
      "may be an initial step toward developing more precise prediction models and\n",

      "and Other Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Promising Targets in a Therapeutic\n",
      "Strategy 1. Introduction, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and several other\n",
      "neuropsychiatric disorders are among the most significant unsolved medical and\n",
      "social problems. Despite intensive studies and significant progress in genetics\n",
      "and molecular biology, the pathomechanism/pathogenesis of AD and most other\n",
      "neurodegenerative/neuropsychiatric diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD),\n",
      "Huntington’s disease (HD), and schizophrenia has not been fully elucidated, and\n",
      "therapeutic approaches are still not effective. Several million people around\n",
      "the world are waiting for novel or repurposing drugs that will be able to retard\n",
      "or ameliorate neurodegeneration. Unfortunately, along with major progress in\n",
      "several fields of science and technology, an increase in psychiatric disorders\n",
      "has been noticed. In the last decades, a significant rise in psychosis,\n",
      "depression, schizophrenia, and several neurodevelopmental diseases, including\n",
      "autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n",
      "(ADHD), has been reported. Statistical analysis from the WHO reveals a 13%\n",
      "increase in mental health disorders over the past 10 years. In AD and other\n",
      "neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental diseases mentioned above,\n",
      "neuroinflammation could play an important role. It should be highlighted that in\n",
      "all these diseases, alterations in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor\n",
      "(PPAR-α, PPAR-γ) signaling may play a crucial pathogenic role (Figure 1)., For\n",
      "the first time, the role of PPARs was described in cardiovascular disorders and\n",
      "metabolic diseases, such as dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes (DMt2). These\n",
      "diseases and obesity also affect cognition and memory. Agonists of PPAR-α exert\n",
      "several positive effects on these disorders. PPARs regulate cell metabolism\n",
      "through genomic and non-genomic pathways (Figure 2)., PPAR-α is a potent\n",
      "transcription factor that regulates genes related to fatty acids (FA) transport\n",
      "and oxidation, cholesterol transport/sulfation, and triglyceride (TG)\n",
      "metabolism. Moreover, PPAR-α regulates the transcription of various neuronal\n",
      "plasticity and memory-associated genes encoding the NMDA receptor subunits\n",
      "(NR2A, NR2B), AMPA receptor subunit (GluR1), and activity-regulated\n",
      "cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc). Additionally, PPAR-α exerts an effect\n",
      "through the nongenomic pathway by regulating intracellular Ca2+ concentration\n",
      "(Ca2+i). PPAR-α via rapid enhancement of Ca2+i significantly influences the\n",
      "level of ROS production, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the insulin\n",
      "level, and the expression of cAMP-response element binding (CREB), which is\n",
      "important in the formation of memory. Recent studies highlight the crucial role\n",
      "of the immediate early gene Arc/Arg 3.1 in synaptic plasticity and memory\n",
      "consolidation. Arc is activated by natural stimuli and memory-related behavioral\n",
      "paradigms. The Arc/Arg3.1 protein is present in the postsynaptic density of\n",
      "glutamatergic neurons., PPAR-α and other members of the PPAR family have been\n",
      "previously described in several original and review articles. In this review, we\n",
      "would like to highlight the basic role of each PPAR receptor in the central\n",
      "nervous system (CNS). All members of these receptors are potent transcription\n",
      "factors; PPAR-α was discovered and characterized as the first. It is widely\n",
      "present in CNS and is engaged in the regulation of mitochondrial fatty acid and\n",
      "cholesterol metabolism. Moreover, this receptor plays an important role in\n",
      "mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, biogenesis, and oxidative stress.\n",
      "PPAR-α plays a crucial role in neurotransmission processes in glutamatergic,\n",
      "cholinergic, and dopaminergic systems, in synaptic plasticity, and in the\n",
      "regulation of mitophagy/autophagy and neuronal death pathways. PPAR-α and PPAR-γ\n",
      "have significant effects on cell differentiation and inflammation (Figure 3).,\n",
      "PPAR-β/δ is mostly present in CNS, similar to PPAR-α, and is involved in cell\n",
      "differentiation and myelination. PPAR-γ is distributed in most of the cells in\n",
      "the human body. The agonists of PPAR-α and PPAR-γ participate in brain\n",
      "signaling, mitochondrial metabolism, and mitophagy. They also take part in the\n",
      "normalization of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, synaptic plasticity, and\n",
      "other processes indicated in Figure 3. Additionally, both of these receptors\n",
      "could play a significant role in lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Moreover,\n",
      "PPAR-α is engaged in cholesterol metabolism and the biosynthesis of\n",
      "neurosteroids., 2. The Role of PPAR-α in the Regulation of Genes Related to\n",
      "Cholesterol and Neurosteroids, The relationship between PPAR-α and neurosteroids\n",

      "neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety, has\n",
      "been analyzed over the last 25 years by several research groups., The question\n",
      "arises of how PPAR-α is related to neurosteroids. It is important to highlight\n",
      "that PPAR-α plays a crucial role in the transcription of two genes engaged in\n",
      "the transport of cholesterol into mitochondria. One of these genes is\n",
      "responsible for encoding the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR,\n",
      "STARD1) and another one encodes the translocator protein (TSPO) (Figure 5)., In\n",
      "AD, the disruption of intracellular cholesterol was reported and the\n",
      "accumulation of cholesterol in mitochondria may affect antioxidative processes\n",
      "and enhance Aβ toxicity. Moreover, the alteration of cholesterol homeostasis may\n",

      "et al.. These authors suggest that StAR/STARD1 could be a promising target in\n",
      "the therapy of AD. However, it seems that the PPAR-α ligands, which regulate the\n",
      "transcription of genes related to cholesterol transport into mitochondria and\n",
      "several other genes, could be more effective and safer and could concomitantly\n",

      "Researchers have suggested that the organization and regulation of GABA receptor\n",

      "inflammatory pathways are targets for neurosteroids and could be responsible for\n",
      "the beneficial actions of PPAR-α. However, neuroinflammation may influence\n",
      "neurosteroid synthesis and the profile of their actions., Recently it was\n",
      "described that the metabolism of mitochondria cholesterol play significant role\n",
      "in redox biology and in AD pathology Goicoechea et al.. These authors\n",
      "highlighted the importance of mechanisms involved in the regulation of\n",
      "cholesterol levels and their metabolism in mitochondria in physiology and\n",
      "pathology. Researchers noticed that the accumulation of cholesterol in\n",
      "mitochondria above the physiological level may affect the assembly of\n",
      "respiratory supercomplexes and may activate oxidative stress. Enhanced levels of\n",
      "cholesterol could exert a negative impact on the antioxidative defense through\n",
      "the glutathione redox cycle., The mitochondrial pool of cholesterol is under\n",
      "precise control and it seems that PPAR-α may play a crucial role in the\n",
      "regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. Mitochondria cholesterol represents about\n",
      "2–4% of the total pool of cholesterol in the cells and is indispensable for the\n",
      "synthesis of steroids, oxysterols, and hepatic bile acids. For many years, it\n",
      "has been suggested that a close association between cholesterol\n",
      "levels/metabolism and AD pathology exists. Recently, Testa et al. noted that\n",
      "24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC) induces Tau proteasome-dependent degradation via\n",
      "the Srt1/PGC-1α/NRF2 pathway. Through this mechanism, 24-OHC may protect the\n",
      "brain against the accumulation of the hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and its\n",
      "neurotoxic effect. Researchers have also suggested that cholesterol—depending on\n",
      "the concentration and metabolism—could play a different role but its homeostasis\n",
      "is crucial for the functioning of the cells. Up until now, the role of\n",
      "cholesterol in AD and other neuropsychiatric disorders has not been fully\n",
      "elucidated. Cholesterol metabolism depends on many factors, including several\n",
      "enzymes, cells, and parts of the brain. In neurons, the conversion of\n",
      "cholesterol to pregnenolone (PREG), the precursor of steroid hormones, is\n",
      "catalyzed by cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc). In neurons,\n",
      "pregnenolone is synthesized as well as DHEA/DHEA-S, androstenedione, and\n",
      "estrogens (Figure 7)., Moreover, other enzymes, including 5α–reductase and\n",
      "3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, are crucial in the synthesis of\n",
      "allopregnanolone (ALLO) and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC). These\n",
      "neurosteroids can be synthesized in the hippocampus, brain cortex, thalamus, and\n",
      "olfactory bulb. The sulfation and desulfation alter the neurosteroid compounds\n",
      "and modify their properties. PPAR-α plays a key role in the regulation of gene\n",
      "expression coding sulfotransferase (SULT) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase.\n",
      "Pregnenolone and allopregnanolone are present in the brain in greater\n",
      "concentrations compared to blood and both pools significantly affect brain\n",
      "function, inflammation, and autophagy. It is widely accepted that inflammation\n",
      "contributes to the pathogenesis of AD and other neuropsychiatric disorders;\n",
      "moreover, inflammation plays a crucial role in neurodevelopmental disorders and\n",
      "it may evoke these pathologies., Based on preclinical studies, researchers have\n",
      "postulated that the alteration of brain cholesterol biosynthesis could be\n",
      "responsible for the changes in cognitive function in AD. However, this subject\n",
      "is still under discussion. The blood–brain barrier is not permeable to\n",
      "cholesterol/lipoproteins, which means that brain cholesterol must be synthesized\n",
      "de novo in the brain. This biosynthesis is especially active during myelination.\n",
      "Cholesterol content in the brain is higher 10 times as compared to other organs\n",
      "and tissues and consists of about 25% of the total body cholesterol. This lipid\n",
      "is an essential compound of all cell membranes, as it forms the lipid rafts\n",
      "together with sphingolipids. These lipid rafts create an appropriate milieu for\n",
      "most of the different types of neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, and\n",
      "amyloid beta precursor proteins (APPs), whose functions are not yet fully\n",
      "explained. However, it is well known that APP-altered metabolism in AD is\n",
      "responsible for the higher liberation of amyloid β, which may play a crucial\n",
      "role in the pathogenesis/pathomechanism of the familiar/genetic form of\n",
      "early-onset AD (EOAD). In sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD), which affects more than\n",
      "90% of AD patients, pathogenesis/pathomechanism is unknown and therapy is\n",
      "unsuccessful. However, in this form of AD, altered metabolism of APP and the\n",
      "toxicity of liberated excess amyloid beta also occur and play an essential but\n",
      "not crucial role. Sáez-Orellana et al. indicated an important correlation\n",
      "between the PPAR-α function and full-length APP expression in LOAD and EOAD. The\n",
      "authors reported that PPAR-α expression and activation were inversely related to\n",
      "APP expression in LOAD and in EOAD but not in the control human brain. PPAR-α\n",
      "deficiency eliminates APP–mediated control of synaptic activity, demonstrating\n",
      "the key role of PPAR-α in this process. Moreover, the alteration of APP\n",
      "metabolism impairs lipid synthesis and synaptic activity, while the activation\n",
      "of PPAR-α improves synaptic plasticity through its effect on lipid metabolism.\n",
      "It could be suggested that PPAR-α may also exert its protective effect on\n",
      "synaptic function through the regulation of cholesterol transport in brain\n",
      "mitochondria and the biosynthesis of neurosteroids., Neuroactive steroids are\n",
      "synthesized de novo in the brain from cholesterol in neurons, oligodendroglia,\n",
      "and astrocytes, and metabolized in microglia, as demonstrated in Figure 7.\n",
      "Neurosteroids are sulfated by sulfotransferases and transcription is regulated\n",
      "by PPAR-α. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated form, DHEA-S, are the\n",
      "most abundant forms of steroids. More than 90% of circulating DHEA is in the\n",
      "sulfated form (as DHEA-S), which powerfully binds to albumins. DHEA and\n",
      "progesterone are precursors for the major sex steroids (estrogen, progesterone,\n",
      "and testosterone). These sex compounds are mainly synthesized in adrenal glands\n",
      "but some are also synthesized in the brain. DHEA and its metabolites decrease\n",
      "significantly during aging and the DHEA-S level declines by about 80% by age 70\n",
      "compared to adult levels. A lower concentration of DHEA-S in plasma and reduced\n",
      "activity of sulfotransferases are considered as risk factors for AD. A lower\n",
      "level of neurosteroids in the brain during aging and in AD could be responsible\n",
      "for the reduced steroid neuroprotective effect. Consequently, the brain is more\n",
      "sensitive to neurotoxins, such as cortisol, and other damaging factors, such as\n",
      "Aβ oligomers. However, about 50 years ago, it was found that sex sterols\n",
      "synthesized in gonads and other periphery organs can cross the blood–brain\n",
      "barrier (BBB) and may exert their effect in the brain, but the level of these\n",
      "compounds significantly decreases during aging., Ongoing research with\n",
      "neuroactive steroids will elucidate the effects of these compounds on the\n",
      "molecular processes in the brain. There is high hope that neuroactive steroids\n",
      "will improve the treatment of depression. Recently developed, rapidly acting\n",
      "antidepressants are promising in the therapy of depression and psychosis, which\n",
      "often appear during AD or PD progression. In 2019, the FDA approved brexanolone,\n",
      "a type of neurosteroid, which exerts a positive effect on postpartum depression\n",
      "(PPD) as well as in the treatment of major depressive disorders (MDDs). The\n",
      "novel rapid-acting neurosteroids were suggested to be able to significantly\n",
      "change the therapeutic strategy of depression and schizophrenia. After many\n",
      "years of treatments with several classic anti-depressants, this FDA-approved\n",
      "allopregnanolone (brexanolone) and antidepressant esketamine (as nasal spray)\n",
      "for PPD and resistant depression, respectively, are expected to significantly\n",
      "improve the treatment of depression. Moreover, the FDA also approved zuranolone,\n",
      "an oral allopregnanolone analog, for both of these types of depression. These\n",
      "compounds act on GABA and NMDA receptors and also have anti-inflammatory agents.\n",
      "It is postulated that the new era for the treatment of neuropsychiatric\n",
      "disorders has just started with the introduction of these rapid-acting\n",
      "psychotropic drugs, including supplementation with dehydroepiandrosterone\n",

      "Nowadays, neurosteroids/neuroactive steroids (NAS), neurosteroid enantiomers,\n",
      "and sulfated neurosteroid enantiomers are expected to be very efficient in the\n",
      "treatment of several neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative disorders.\n",
      "Unfortunately, recently several side effects were reported; these drugs should\n",
      "be carefully applied with very restricted, appropriate doses., Previously, Grimm\n",
      "et al. analyzed the effects of seven structurally diverse neurosteroids, which\n",
      "may have implications for age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Several\n",
      "neurosteroids, such as progesterone, estradiol, estrone, testosterone, DHEA, and\n",
      "allopregnanolone, exert positive effects on the redox state by activating\n",
      "antioxidative defense and mitochondria function. These steroids improve\n",
      "mitochondrial respiration and the synthesis of ATP in an age-dependent manner\n",
      "and can positively influence the membrane’s potential. It seems that\n",
      "neurosteroids—acting through their specific receptors—could be involved in\n",
      "neuroprotective events, which occur concomitantly with degenerative processes\n",
      "during aging or progressive neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD or PD.\n",
      "Allopregnanolone has been shown to exert a neuroprotective effect through\n",
      "several molecular pathways, including the GABA receptor, CREB, and Ca-regulated\n",
      "processes. It significantly activates neurogenesis, a proliferation of neuronal\n",
      "progenitor cells (NPCs). Moreover, it promotes the clearance of cholesterol and\n",
      "maintains its homeostasis and Aβ peptide homeostasis. Allopregnanolone and\n",
      "testosterone exert positive effects by modulating the GABAA receptor, by\n",
      "reducing glutamate release, IL1β, and TNF expression. It seems that through\n",
      "these pathways, neurosteroids may also exert an effect on neuropathic pain.\n",
      "Moreover, these neurosteroids act through other mechanisms, including the\n",
      "activation of factors related to peripheral myelination, as indicated in\n",
      "preclinical studies involving animal models. Additionally, neurosteroids improve\n",
      "mitochondrial activity and functions. An enigmatic relationship between estrogen\n",
      "and mitochondria in AD was described by Grimm et al.. It has been known for a\n",
      "long time that mitochondria are highly vulnerable to Aβ and tau toxicity and it\n",
      "was suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction could be an early event during\n",
      "aging and AD/PD pathology. It was demonstrated that the synthesis of\n",
      "neurosteroids decreased during aging. The lower concentrations of DHEA and other\n",
      "neuroactive steroids exert significant effects on most intracellular signaling\n",
      "pathways and autophagy, affecting memory and learning ability., The previous\n",
      "study indicated a close link between PPAR-α, the neurosteroidogenic pathway, and\n",
      "the GABA receptor. This pathway mediates signaling in several neuropsychiatric\n",
      "disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression,\n",
      "schizophrenia, substance use disorders, drug addiction, and several\n",
      "neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD and PD. Recently, Covey et al.\n",
      "highlighted that there has been significant interest in the last few years in\n",
      "developing neurosteroid enantiomers as novel promising compounds for the\n",
      "treatment of AD. The lower concentrations of DHEA-S and other neuroactive\n",

      "dose—neurosteroids will be able to improve the treatment of neurodegenerative\n",

      "neuropsychiatric disorders, neuroinflammation plays a crucial role.\n",
      "Neuroinflammation may be neuroprotective, however, it may also lead to\n",
      "neurodegeneration or even evoke neurodegenerative disorders. In the last few\n",
      "years, several pieces of data, which have been obtained from positron emission\n",

      "reducing oxidative stress, liberating cytokines such as IL1, IL6, and TNF-α, and\n",
      "decreasing pro-inflammatory enzymes. The association between PPAR-α and\n",

      "in female animal models, as indicated in the study by Dotson et al. and Dunn et\n",
      "al.. It seems that this subject should be further investigated. It has been\n",
      "proposed that, in most cases, the positive cytoprotective effect of fenofibrate\n",
      "depends on tissues and their genetic arrangements. It was reported that\n",
      "fenofibrate has beneficial effects on brain ischemia, diabetic retinopathy,\n",

      "several clinical trials indicated that fibrates may enhance the level of\n",
      "cystatin C and homocysteine in the blood, but this subject needs further\n",
      "elucidation., The results by Dotson et al. and Dunn et al. suggest that males\n",

      "that the PPAR-α agonist, fenofibrate, significantly improves stroke outcomes and\n",
      "affects inflammation in male mice but it has no effect in females. Moreover, it\n",
      "was found that the level of PPAR-α expression in female brains is lower compared\n",
      "to male brains. These data could be very important because they may indicate\n",

      "Different effects between genders could possibly be connected with the\n",
      "neurosteroid sex differences reported by Raciti et al. and with their different\n",
      "levels and actions in men and women. It was reported that declining testosterone\n",
      "levels have been associated with an increased risk for AD and cognition\n",

      "difficult to evaluate the concentration of neurosteroids in different parts of\n",
      "the human brain in a gender-specific manner in physiological and pathological\n",
      "conditions. It should be highlighted that gene expression for PPAR-α,\n",
      "cholesterol/neurosteroid enzymes, and signaling pathways could be\n",
      "species-specific, and the data from different experimental models ought to be\n",
      "considered carefully., Recently, several novel pharmacologically active compound\n",
      "agonists, PPAR-α ligands, and neurosteroids have been investigated, and some\n",
      "were introduced to the treatment of depression, which should significantly\n",
      "improve the therapeutic strategies of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, many\n",
      "side effects were also reported; this aspect should be very carefully considered\n",
      "during their application. Moreover, the signaling pathways evoked by PPAR-α and\n",
      "its interaction with other receptors from this family, such as PPAR-γ, may\n",
      "enhance the chances of improving neuroprotection in AD and other\n",
      "neurodegenerative/neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, the neuroprotective\n",
      "effect of neurosteroids via GABAA receptor-mediated signaling should be\n",
      "promising in the treatment of AD/PD, peripheral neuropathies, and neuropathic\n",
      "pain. Neuroactive steroids, apart from the activation of specific steroid\n",
      "membrane receptors through modulation of GABAA and GABAB, exert additional\n",
      "effects on NMDA and 5-HT3. Neurosteroids synthesized in the brain, as well as\n",
      "circulating steroids synthesized in peripheral organs, which readily cross the\n",
      "blood–brain barrier (BBA), significantly affect neuroinflammation, which is a\n",
      "crucial component of AD, PD, MS, and other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as\n",
      "schizophrenia or bipolar disorders. However, it should be noted that\n",
      "inflammation might influence neurosteroid levels and actions. Over the last 5\n",
      "years, the FDA approved three novel compounds, including neurosteroids for the\n",
      "treatment of depression. To summarize, it can be expected that in the near\n",
      "future, novel synthetic PPAR-α ligand receptors, as well as novel synthetic\n",
