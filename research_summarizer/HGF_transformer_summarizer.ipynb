      "functions. SFN is a common disorder with a prevalence of 131.5 per 100,000\n",
      "inhabitants. It presents with diverse symptoms, including sensory issues and\n",
      "autonomic dysfunction, with neuropathic pain (NP) being the prominent feature.\n",
      "Diagnosing SFN poses a challenge due to the variable intensity and distribution\n",
      "of symptoms, which predominantly affect the lower extremities and may extend to\n",
      "the upper limbs. Routine clinical examinations often fail to detect\n",

      "14, 39%) had normal IENFD. Most of the patients from the Netherlands (n = 24,\n",
      "75%) had abnormal TTT, while only eight (25%) patients had normal TTT values; in\n",
      "four patients TTT was not performed. Demographic and clinical features of the\n",
      "studied cohorts are reported in Table 1., 2.2. Identification of Genetic\n",
      "Variants, In this study, we performed WES experiments to identify genetic\n",
      "variants in EO-SFN patients. The quality of the obtained data was evaluated\n",
      "based on several aspects as mean coverage per sample, coverage of the target\n",
      "regions per sample, and the transition–transversion (Ti/Tv) ratio to assess the\n",
      "variant quality and percentage of duplication. The mean coverage per sample was\n",
      "70X, the average percentage of target bases covered at 30X was 74.8%, the\n",
      "average Ti/Tv ratio was 2.45 and the percentage of duplication was lower than\n",
      "10%, Eight heterozygous variants in three genes were classified as ’Pathogenic’\n",
      "and are listed in Table 2. Among them, we identified three concurrent SCN9A\n",
      "variants (c.2971G>T, c.2794A>C and c.5756A>G) in two patients from both cohorts;\n",
      "these subjects had classical SFN, exhibiting burning pain in the lower legs.\n",
      "Beyond VGSC variants, we identified WFS1 variants, that have been previously\n",
      "reported to alter protein function in peripheral neuropathy (PN) patients with\n",
      "diabetes mellitus. WFS1 variants were seen in ITA42 and NET11 individuals; only\n",
      "NET11 had glucose intolerance., Fifteen heterozygous variants in twelve genes\n",
      "were classified as Likely Pathogenic (LP) and are reported in Table 3. Among\n",
      "them, two variants map to VGSC genes (SCN9A: c.4612T>C and SCN10A: c.3674T>C),\n",
      "whereas three variants map to ATP7B gene. Notably, in individual ITA04, two LP\n",
      "variants (ATP7B: c.1993A>G and COL6A2: c.1572+1G>A) were reported; we observed\n",
      "that these variants co-segregated in their relatives diagnosed with SFN and\n",
      "distal myopathy. Additionally, two genetic variants in the LZTR1 gene,\n",
      "previously linked to schwannomatosis, were observed. Among the 12 mutated genes\n",
      "listed in Table 3, only 4 (ATL1, PMP22, SCN9A, and SCN10A) have been previously\n",
      "associated with SFN., Variants in genes associated with inherited peripheral\n",
      "neuropathies (IPN), characterised by distinct genetic inheritance patterns like\n",
      "Charcot–Marie–Tooth Disease, were also examined. These variants, categorised as\n",
      "either LP or Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), are detailed in Table 4.\n",
      "In particular, KIF1A and NAGLU were frequently selected, especially in patients\n",
      "experiencing symptoms such as burning pain and sheet intolerance., In the\n",
      "present study, we found 119 variants in heterozygous state that were categorized\n",
      "as VUS in 86 genes, as listed in Table S2. To better understand the functional\n",
      "biological systems they belong to, we categorized these genes into four groups:\n",
      "‘Ion channels’, ‘Neurotransmission’, ‘Metabolism’, and ‘Immune response’, based\n",
      "on Calvo, M et al.,. We observed that the majority of genes with VUS variants\n",
      "were found in the ‘Neurotransmission’ group, followed by the ‘Ion channels’\n",
      "category, as shown in Figure 2., 2.3. Summary of Prioritized Variants, To\n",
      "summarize, VGSC gene variants were observed in 23.8% of subjects, while TRP\n",
      "channel gene variants were seen in 19.3% of cases; 6.81% of subjects had no\n",
      "prioritized variants. Table 5 displays the top 10 genes with the highest sample\n",
      "count of prioritized variants in the analysed cohort, categorised based on their\n",
      "observed prevalence in individuals. It is important to note that each occurrence\n",
      "of the same variant has been counted separately when present in different\n",
      "individuals., 2.4. Pathway Analysis, To evaluate the enrichment in specific\n",
      "biological processes, a pathway analysis was conducted separately in cases and\n",
      "healthy controls using the WebGestalt tool and the PANTHER database as displayed\n",
      "in Figure 1B. The analysis was performed without applying a gene panel filter,\n",
      "to avoid bias related to the pre-selection of painful SFN genes. After the\n",
      "application of the variant filtering pipelines explained in the Methods section,\n",
      "we selected 4254 genes in cases and 1226 genes in controls. The WebGestalt tool\n",
      "selects unambiguously annotated genes from the chosen database, which reduces\n",
      "the number of input genes available for pathway analysis; for this reason, only\n",
      "589 genes for cases and 191 genes for controls were considered as input for\n",
      "pathway analysis using the PANTHER database. The top five pathways that emerged\n",
      "from cases and controls are described in Table 6A,B, respectively., The\n",
      "‘Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Signaling’ (NARS) pathway was the only one\n",
      "significantly enriched in cases (FDR < 0.10 and p < 0.001); no pathways were\n",
      "significantly enriched in healthy control. The NARS pathway includes 93 genes;\n",
      "52 out of the 589 input genes were part of this pathway. When checking the\n",
      "variants mapping to the 52 genes, we observed two variants in CHRNA6 and CACNA1S\n",
      "that were found to be causative and classified as VUS. 3. Discussion, We applied\n",
      "WES to identify genetic variants and genes involved in painful SFN, which mainly\n",
      "affects individuals with age of onset around 50. In the present study, we\n",
      "focused on well-characterised cohorts of patients with early SFN onset (≤45\n",
      "years) to increase the likelihood of finding variants involved in the genetic\n",
      "predisposition to painful SFN. We included samples from two distinct European\n",
      "origins (Italy and The Netherlands) who share comparable clinical features. To\n",
      "prioritize variants involved in pain, we manually curated a gene panel\n",
      "encompassing all the phenotypes and the clinical symptoms associated with\n",
      "painful SFN., The cohort analysis unveiled two subjects harboring identical\n",
      "combinations of SCN9A genetic variants, as illustrated in Table 2. Moreover, a\n",
      "consistent trend emerged across both European cohorts; in fact, we observed that\n",
      "some of the genes mutated in one cohort were also mutated in the other cohort.\n",
      "Detailed discussion on the genetic variants observed in VGSC genes, WFS1,\n",
      "COL7A1, ATP7B, and TRPA1 genes are provided subsequently., 3.1. Voltage-Gated\n",
      "Sodium Channel Variants, In the analysed cohorts, two individuals had three\n",
      "identical SCN9A variants. Two of these variants, SCN9A: c.2971G>T and SCN9A:\n",
      "c.2794A>C, were found to be in cis with each other and were classified as\n",
      "‘Pathogenic’ based on functional and genetic studies; a study indicated that the\n",
      "combination of all three variants contributes to NP. Among the SCN9A variants,\n",
      "three were newly identified, while the others have been previously reported.\n",
      "Three out of the four SCN10A variants were novel, as well as all the SCN11A\n",
      "variants. The SCN10A: c.41G>T was observed in two individuals and had been\n",
      "previously reported in four SFN patients; however the familial co-segregation\n",
      "study was inconclusive for this variant. Our findings are in line with other\n",
      "genetic studies related to SFN, indicating that SCN9A variants are more\n",
      "prevalent than other VGSC variants; however, they do not fully explain the\n",
      "observed phenotype. It is important to note that variants in VGSC variants are\n",
      "widely distributed across the channel, implying that there is no specific\n",
      "hotspot region that can be pinpointed with certainty., 3.2. WFS1 Pathogenic\n",
      "Variants, The variants mapping to WFS1 (Wolframin ER Transmembrane Glycoprotein)\n",
      "were classified as ‘Pathogenic’ and had been associated with neurodegenerative\n",
      "disorders, including non-classic WFS1 Spectrum Disorders (WSD). Non-classic WSD\n",
      "has autosomal dominant inheritance, causing neurological abnormalities, glucose\n",
      "intolerance, hearing loss, and psychiatric disorders. According to the\n",
      "literature, autosomal recessive inheritance leads to the absence of protein\n",
      "formation, and conversely, autosomal dominant inheritance, leads to modification\n",
      "of the protein product, with the disruption of calcium homeostasis via the\n",
      "endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway and the axonal degeneration in small\n",
      "fibers. Because calcium dyshomeostasis is also involved in SFN pathogenesis, the\n",
      "variants in WFS1 were classified as ‘Pathogenic’. As reported in Table 2, we\n",
      "identified two heterozygous variants in ITA42 and NET11 individuals carrying the\n",
      "WFS1:c.409_424dupGGCCGTCGCGAGGCTG, and WFS1:c.2648_2651delTCTT variants\n",
      "respectively. The variant identified in ITA42 individuals causes a complete loss\n",
      "of the WFS1 protein due to an early stop signal, which is associated with\n",
      "recessive WSD and type II diabetes mellitus with neurodegeneration. The variant\n",
      "detected in NET11 individuals, who exhibit glucose intolerance alongside SFN, is\n",
      "known to cause a complete breakdown of the WFS1 protein. According to De Heredia\n",
      "et al., both the reported variants fall under genotypic class A, which means\n",
      "that no protein product is generated. Due to haploinsufficiency, these variants\n",
      "may also be causative in the dominant mode of inheritance. Based on these data,\n",
      "we have classified these two variants as ‘Pathogenic’ in our cohort., 3.3.\n",
      "COL7A1 Likely Pathogenic Variants, Among the LP category, we have identified two\n",
      "variants in COL7A1 (Collagen Type VII Alpha 1 Chain). The reported variants\n",
      "(Table 3) have been previously linked to various forms of ‘Epidermolysis\n",
      "bullosa’ (EB) and can be inherited in both dominant and recessive modes. This\n",
      "particular gene was chosen because its variants exhibit phenotypes other than\n",
      "EB, including NP and sensory impairment. Recently, individuals with EB have been\n",
      "observed with a significant decrease in IENFD, which is also linked with SFN. In\n",
      "ITA34 individuals, we observed a frameshift variant (COL7A1:c.497dupA), which\n",
      "has been previously reported in both the dominant and recessive forms of EB.\n",
      "Another variant (COL7A1: c.4373C>T) was found in NET33 subjects, who had both\n",
      "itch (known symptom of EB) and painful SFN. This variant was previously found in\n",
      "patients with EB in dominant form; however, it was not the direct cause of EB.\n",
      "This leads us to question whether this variant is more closely related to SFN\n",
      "rather than EB. Schmidt et al. found that mutations in the COL7A1 gene in EB\n",
      "patients reduced IEFND and may lead to SFN. As it has not been previously\n",
      "associated with SFN, we have classified COL7A1 variants as LP., 3.4. ATP7B\n",
      "Genetic Variants, As part of this study, we identified six heterozygous variants\n",
      "in the ATP7B (ATPase Copper Transporting Beta) gene as shown in Figure S1. This\n",
      "gene is linked to Wilson’s disease in its recessive form and is associated with\n",
      "intellectual disability, enteropathy, deafness, peripheral neuropathy,\n",
      "ichthyosis and keratodermia (MEDNIK) syndrome in its dominant form. Wilson’s\n",
      "disease is characterised by copper build-up and symptoms including liver\n",
      "malfunction and neurological abnormalities. The ATP7B gene is also associated\n",
      "with SFN, and demyelinating polyneuropathy may occur with moderate Wilson’s\n",
      "disease symptoms. In the case of MEDNIK syndrome, it is known that it may\n",
      "present with both PN and itch. We hypothesize that mutations in the ATP7B gene\n",
      "may cause these symptoms through disruptions in the AP1 protein complex, which\n",
      "is responsible for protein sorting, impacting the intracellular trafficking of\n",
      "ATP7B copper pumps. Indeed, mutations in the associated AP1S1 (Adaptor Related\n",
      "Protein Complex 1 Subunit Sigma 1) gene can impact copper metabolism,\n",
      "contributing to MEDNIK syndrome. Disruptions in copper levels may affect ATP7B\n",
      "polarity, leading to abnormal copper metabolism and the manifestation of MEDNIK\n",
      "syndrome. All the reported variants in this gene either affect the protein\n",
      "folding or disrupt the copper transportation. Although ATP7B variants are\n",
      "typically associated with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, the\n",
      "ATP7B:c.3207C>A heterozygous variant has been previously reported in individuals\n",
      "with sensory disturbances; it has been speculated that subjects with this\n",
      "variant have a late-onset of the disease and neurological defects. Additionally,\n",
      "the ATP7B:c.1993A>G variant has been confirmed to follow an autosomal dominant\n",
      "inheritance pattern, as it segregated with the disease in affected members of a\n",
      "family in Table 3., 3.5. Enrichment of TRPA1 Variants, We identified five TRPA1\n",
      "genetic variants in six individuals in the VUS category, as shown in Figure S2.\n",
      "TRPA1 contains a long ankyrin repeat domain at the N-terminus, which is a known\n",
      "hotspot region of this gene. Mutations in TRPA1, particularly in the ankyrin\n",
      "repeat domain, sensitize the channel and lead to the induction of pain.\n",
      "Additionally, genetic variants in this domain are recognized for their\n",
      "activation by cold temperatures. In this study, two patients, ITA28 and ITA50,\n",
      "experienced cold allodynia, while another two, NET19 and NET31, who have the\n",
      "same variant, showed sheet intolerance. All identified TRPA1 variants were\n",
      "located in the hotspot region of this channel. The genetic pathophysiology of\n",
      "SFN and pain is likely influenced by variants located in this hotspot region of\n",
      "TRPA1. Due to a lack of functional study on these variants, we classified them\n",
      "as VUS., 3.6. NARS Pathway, To better understand the functional role of genes\n",
      "involved in the phenotype of interest, a pathway analysis was performed. The\n",
      "analysis revealed the NARS pathway as the only significant one. It consists of\n",
      "13 components, including Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors (NARs) and calcium\n",
      "ion channels. NARs are ligand-gated ion channels, formed by pentameric protein\n",
      "subunits, that play a crucial role in rapid signal transmission at synapses.\n",
      "Different subunit combinations form NAR subtypes, which are present in different\n",
      "regions of the nervous system. In dorsal root ganglia (DRG), NARs are involved\n",
      "in pain transmission by assisting in neuronal excitability. Mutations in genes\n",
      "encoding NAR subunits can affect pain transmission. In our cohorts, rare VUS\n",
      "variants were found in CHRNA6 and CACNA1S genes, which are part of the NARS\n",
      "pathway. As regards the CHRNA6 gene, it is known that loss-of-function variants\n",
      "in this gene increase allodynia, whereas gain-of-function mutations decrease\n",
      "pain. It was also reported that the expression of the α6β4 (encodes for CHRNA6\n",
      "gene) subtype desensitizes the P2X2/3 receptors, which inhibits them and\n",
      "diminishes pain. Variants found in the CACNA1S gene are associated with myalgic\n",
      "myopathy, linking it with pain transmission., The variants discovered in this\n",
      "study will offer valuable insights into personalized treatments for pain relief.\n",
      "Indeed, NARs are potential therapeutic targets for pain, while calcium ion\n",
      "channels are already established pain targets. 5. Conclusions, This study\n",
      "contributes to elucidating the complex genetic nature of painful SFN in EO\n",
      "individuals for whom we expect a genetic predisposition leading to the early\n",
      "onset phenotype. The WES approach proved to be effective in detecting causative\n",
      "variants and establishing genotype-phenotype relationships. The compiled gene\n",
      "list consists of 93 genes prioritized as ‘Pathogenic’, LP, and VUS; we propose\n",
      "that this list may function as an initial screening tool in genetic\n",
      "investigations. However, validation of this gene list in larger cohorts with\n",
      "diverse ethnicities is essential., The genetic variants selected by our study\n",
      "were absent in HC; their corresponding genes implicated different functional\n",
      "processes, including VGSC genes, TRP genes, and copper metabolism-related genes,\n",
      "which suggest their involvement in disease initiation and pain regulation as\n",
      "shown in Figure 3. Pathway analysis revealed that there is an enrichment in the\n",
      "NARS pathway in patients compared to healthy controls; based on this data we can\n",
      "speculate on the disruption of the synaptic transmission mechanism as a probable\n",
      "pathogenic mechanism participating in disease manifestation. This study\n",
      "highlights the clinical relevance of WES, emphasizing its capacity to advance\n",
      "diagnosis and potentially identify treatment targets for a clinically\n",
      "heterogeneous condition like SFN. The results potentially lay the groundwork for\n",
      "genetic screening initiatives and may catalyze new functional studies into genes\n",
      "such as COL7A1 and TRPA1. These studies could have broader implications,\n",
      "influencing therapeutic development for patients affected not only by SFN but\n",
      "also by various forms of painful PN., This figure illustrates the potential\n",
      "biological functions of each gene and the impact of mutations on these processes\n",
      "as reported in the literature (adapted from Lischka, A. et al. and Hardiman, O.\n",

      "Differential roles of lysosomal cholesterol transporters in the development of\n",
      "C. elegans NMJs Introduction, The establishment of synaptic connections in the\n",
      "nervous system is important for the efficient transmission of information and\n",
      "the proper functioning of neural circuits. At synapses, presynaptic vesicle\n",
      "fusion machinery and postsynaptic receptors are anchored by respective scaffold\n",
      "proteins, which are physically linked to the intracellular cytoskeleton and the\n",
      "trans-synaptic cell-adhesion molecules. Synapses can be organized through\n",
      "trans-synaptic signaling pathways that are mediated by cell-adhesion molecules\n",
      "such as neurexins and their ligands. Non-neuronal cells that are not part of\n",
      "pre- or postsynaptic specialization can also contribute to synapse formation\n",
      "through direct contact or the secretion of factors. One of these secreted\n",
      "factors is cholesterol, which is an essential component of both presynaptic\n",
      "vesicles and postsynaptic lipid rafts and plays crucial roles in\n",
      "neurotransmission and synaptic signaling. Synapses primarily develop after\n",
      "astrocyte differentiation, and it has been shown that cholesterol derived from\n",
      "the astrocyte significantly promotes the formation and maturation of synapses in\n",
      "vitro. Astrocytic cholesterol is also critical for maintaining cholesterol\n",
      "homeostasis in neurons. Astrocytes secrete apolipoprotein E (ApoE) particles\n",
      "containing cholesterol, which are subsequently taken up by neurons via receptors\n",
      "belonging to the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. Apart from\n",
      "cholesterol, ApoE particles carry a variety of microRNAs that actively repress\n",
      "cholesterol biosynthesis in neurons. Disturbances in the cholesterol synthesis\n",
      "and secretion in astrocytes have been associated with synaptic deficits and\n",
      "neurodegenerative disorders. Despite the importance of intercellular crosstalk,\n",
      "our knowledge about the intracellular mechanisms controlling cholesterol\n",
      "homeostasis in neurons and its role in synapse development remains limited., A\n",
      "few studies have shown that molecules associated with cholesterol synthesis,\n",
      "uptake, and turnover in neurons can influence synapse formation or maintenance.\n",
      "Although postnatal cerebellar granule cells deficient in cholesterol\n",
      "biosynthesis develop normal synapses with Purkinje cells, hippocampal neurons\n",
      "deficient in cholesterol biosynthesis form fewer synapses when cultured with a\n",
      "minimal presence of glial cells. It is possible that cultured neurons develop\n",
      "non-natural synaptic connections, or their requirements for cholesterol\n",
      "synthesis vary depending on brain regions or the age of the animals from which\n",
      "they are obtained. Deletion of low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein\n",
      "1 (LRP1) in forebrain neurons of mice results in a decrease in brain cholesterol\n",
      "levels and a progressive, age-dependent decline in synapses. The overexpression\n",
      "of CYP46A1, a 24-hydroxylase that converts excess cholesterol to\n",
      "24S-hydroxycholesterol, in hippocampal neurons alleviates spine loss in a mouse\n",
      "model with Alzheimer’s disease. These in vivo studies have implicated the\n",
      "critical role of neuronal cholesterol homeostasis in synapse maintenance.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the causal link between impaired cholesterol homeostasis and\n",
      "synaptic deficits has yet to be established., Neurons rely on de novo\n",
      "cholesterol biosynthesis for their survival and growth during early development\n",
      "in addition to the glial supply of cholesterol in later stages. In rodent\n",
      "brains, inactivation of cholesterol synthesis in postnatal neurons is required\n",
      "for studying the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis during synapse\n",
      "development. However, simply using Cre or Cre-ER to induce gene inactivation\n",
      "does not guarantee complete deletion of cholesterol synthesis genes before\n",
      "astrocyte differentiation, nor does it eliminate the residue cholesterol\n",
      "synthesized in embryonic neurons. Therefore, how exogenous cholesterol achieves\n",
      "homeostasis within neurons to ensure proper synapse development remains an open\n",
      "question. We sought to determine first whether cholesterol homeostasis is\n",
      "important and how it is important in Caenorhabditis elegans. Neurons in C.\n",
      "elegans cannot de novo synthesize sterols as they lack genes for squalene\n",
      "synthase and cyclase, and they require dietary cholesterol for development. The\n",
      "use of C. elegans would enable us to investigate cholesterol homeostasis\n",
      "regulation in neurons and its role in synapse development., After endocytosis,\n",
      "cholesteryl esters undergo hydrolysis in lysosomes, yielding unesterified\n",
      "cholesterol that is subsequently exported to various cellular compartments. The\n",
      "NPC1 protein, a multiple transmembrane protein located on LE/Ly, is primarily\n",
      "responsible for the egress of cholesterol from lysosomes to other cellular\n",
      "compartments in mammals. The C. elegans genome encodes two NPC1 homologs, ncr-1\n",
      "and ncr-2, known to participate in intracellular cholesterol processing, hormone\n",
      "production, and reproductive growth. In this study, we first examined\n",
      "cholesterol levels and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in ncr-1 and ncr-2 null\n",
      "mutants. NCR-1 promotes cholesterol absorption and the development of NMJs.\n",
      "ncr-1(0) mutants exhibit smaller NMJs. A low-cholesterol diet exacerbates the\n",

      "due to elevated ACAT activity., We further stained neutral lipids using Oil Red\n",
      "O (ORO), a lipophilic dye validated to accurately assess major fat storage in\n",
      "worms. Consistent with previous studies, daf-2 mutants exhibited a significant\n",

      "larval stages, NCR-1::GFP(cfu39) was observed at the peripheries of intestine\n",

      "S1 and S2)., Because of the low expression levels of NCR-1 and NCR-2 in multiple\n",
      "tissues (Fig S6D and E), we employed overexpression to determine their\n",
      "subcellular localization. Given that both NCR-1 and NCR-2 function in neurons\n",
      "(Fig 5), we used a pan-neuronal promoter (F25B3.3p) to overexpress NCR-1::GFP\n",
      "and NCR-2::GFP specifically in neurons (Fig 6A). Both GFP-tagged proteins are\n",
      "functional, as GFP was inserted after the same residues as cfu39(ncr-1::GFP) and\n",

      "elegans motor neurons as a model, we have demonstrated the critical role of\n",
      "neuronal cholesterol homeostasis in synapse development. Our results reveal that\n",
      "two lysosomal cholesterol transporters have distinct functions in cholesterol\n",
      "homeostasis. In particular, NCR-1 promotes synapse development by increasing\n",
      "cholesterol absorption, whereas NCR-2 hinders synapse development by\n",
      "facilitating the use of cholesterol and sphingomyelins (Fig 6D)., Both ncr-1 and\n",

      "double mutants are unable to grow without cholesterol and their growth defects\n",
      "can be rescued by dafachronic acids derived from cholesterol. Our research\n",
      "demonstrates that NCR-1 and NCR-2 exert distinct effects on cholesterol levels.\n",
      "A prior study using dehydroergosterol (DHE), a natural fluorescent analog of\n",
      "cholesterol, did not reveal any changes in sterol distribution in worms fed\n",
      "bacteria containing dsRNA targeting the ncr-1 genes. It is important to note\n",
      "that the outcomes of RNA interference and null mutants may differ. Furthermore,\n",
      "the esterified form of DHE exhibits fluorescence similar to non-esterified DHE,\n",
      "making them indistinguishable under a UV-sensitive wide-field microscope.\n",
      "Therefore, the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in worms treated with ncr-1\n",
      "dsRNA or lacking ncr-1 might mask any reduction in cholesterol levels when\n",
      "employing the DHE method., Although recent studies have shown that other\n",
      "lysosomal membrane proteins also facilitate cholesterol egress, the main source\n",
      "of knowledge regarding the role of lysosomal cholesterol transporters in the\n",
      "nervous system derives from research conducted on NPC1. NPC1 is expressed in\n",
      "both glia and neurons in the rodent brain. The effects of NPC1 on the survival\n",
      "of Purkinje neurons (PNs) have been considered cell-autonomous. Deletion of npc1\n",
      "specifically in PNs causes PN loss in WT mice, whereas the expression of npc1\n",
      "specifically in PNs corrects cholesterol accumulation and prevents PN loss in\n",
      "npc1−/− mice. Interestingly, NPC1 also functions in a non–cell-autonomous\n",
      "manner. For example, the astrocyte-specific expression of NPC1 reduces neuronal\n",
      "cholesterol, delays neurodegeneration, and extends survival. Moreover,\n",
      "neuron-specific deletion of npc1 blocks oligodendrocyte maturation and\n",
      "subsequent myelination, and cortical neurons co-cultured with NPC1-deficient\n",
      "astrocytes exhibit impaired neurite outgrowth. In the present study, NCR-1\n",
      "influences synapse development in neurons, whereas NCR-2 impacts synapse\n",
      "development in both neurons and muscle cells (Fig 5). NCR-2 in muscles might\n",
      "hinder postsynaptic differentiation, which, in turn, compromises presynaptic\n",
      "differentiation. Alternatively, lipids or cholesterol-derived metabolites\n",
